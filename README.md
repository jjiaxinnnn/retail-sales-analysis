**Dataset**<br/>

**Author**: Mehmet Tahir Aslan<br/>
This dataset from Kaggle contains shopping information from 10 different shopping malls in Istanbul between 2021 and 2023, which allows us to understand the shopping trends and patterns in Istanbul (Aslan, 2023). However, I only used the data from 2021 to 2022 as the data for 2023 is incomplete.
Although no data cleaning or pre-processing was needed, I performed additional data aggregation tasks.
These included categorising age into specific age groups, computing total sales made by each customer by
multiplying item prices with quantity, and determining the day of the week based on the invoice dates.
